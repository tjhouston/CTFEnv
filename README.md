# CTF Attackbox Setup
If you are using the hosted CTF attack boxes, you don't always have the tools you need. Created a script to install all of my tools and folders for each attack. 

## To Do
### Add To Setup Scripts
- sudo msfdb init
- add alias for update. kaliupdate : sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove
